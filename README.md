"ðŸš€ Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey Repository! ðŸ¤–

Aspiring data enthusiast and educator with a passion for sharing knowledge and fostering practical machine learning skills. Former Teaching Assistant for Data Mining at Tarbiat Modares University, where I introduced Python-based machine learning to master's and PhD students, focusing on the application side of algorithms and techniques.

In Summer 2023, I embarked on an exciting adventure as an instructor at Khatam University Summer School. Join me in a comprehensive project-based Machine Learning course that covers the A to Z of this fascinating field. From Python essentials and powerful visualization to diving deep into classification algorithms, evaluation techniques, and the intricacies of clustering. I believe in demystifying the math and algorithms while nurturing a solid understanding of their real-world applications through Python coding.

On this GitHub page, I'm delighted to share the codes and materials from every session. Let's explore, learn, and master the world of Machine Learning together! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š"
