"Welcome to my machine learning journey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated data enthusiast with a passion for demystifying machine learning concepts through hands-on projects. As a former teaching assistant at Tarbiat Modares University, I had the privilege of introducing master's and PhD students to Python-based machine learning, focusing on real-world applications of algorithms.

Now, I'm excited to be an instructor at Khatam University's Summer School 2023, guiding students through a comprehensive project-based machine learning course. We'll cover everything from Python fundamentals to data visualization, classification techniques, clustering algorithms, and evaluation methods. No heavy math, just intuitive explanations and lots of hands-on coding.

This GitHub repository contains all the code, notebooks, and materials from the 2023 summer school course. You'll find scripts and notebooks for regression, neural networks, SVM, KNN, decision trees, PCA, K-means, evaluation metrics, and more. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š

Please note - these resources were originally prepared for a live teaching environment. While I've tried to add comments and explanations in the code, some parts may still seem abstruse without the context of the lectures. I apologize for any confusion, and will continue improving the notes to stand alone as reference material.

Whether you're just starting out in machine learning or looking to cement your knowledge through coding, I hope you'll find these materials enlightening. Let's master machine learning together, one step at a time! ðŸš€

Please feel free to use these resources, provide feedback, and get in touch with any questions!"
