Welcome to my machine learning journey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated data enthusiast with a passion for demystifying machine learning concepts through hands-on projects. As a former teaching assistant at Tarbiat Modares University, I had the privilege of introducing master's and PhD students to Python-based machine learning, focusing on real-world applications of algorithms.

Now, I'm excited to be an instructor at Khatam University's Summer School 2023, guiding students through a comprehensive project-based machine learning course. We'll cover everything from Python fundamentals to data visualization, classification techniques, clustering algorithms, and evaluation methods. No heavy math, just intuitive explanations and lots of hands-on coding.

This GitHub repository contains all the code, datasets, and materials from the 2023 summer school course. You'll find notebooks and scripts for regression, neural networks, SVM, KNN, decision trees, PCA, K-means, evaluation metrics, and more.ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š

Whether you're just starting out in machine learning or looking to cement your knowledge through coding, I hope you'll find these materials enlightening. Let's master machine learning together, one step at a time!ðŸš€
